# Harry Potter Directory

This is a simple React app that serves as a directory of characters from the Harry Potter universe. The app uses the [HP API](https://hp-api.onrender.com/api/characters) to fetch and display character information. The primary goal of this project is to practice using multiple React components, routing, and integrating an external API.

## Features

- **Character List:** Displays a list of characters from the Harry Potter series.
- **Character Details:** Clicking on a character's name takes you to a detailed view of that character.
- **Routing:** Different pages are created using React Router to navigate between the character list and character details.
- **Multiple Components:** The app is structured with multiple components to promote reusability and maintainability.
